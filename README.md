This is a class project as part of the UC San Diego MOOC "Object-oriented Programming in Java", offered through Coursera
https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-object-oriented

It automatically generates an interactive map of the earthquakes which happened during the past week, parsing an RSS feed by the United States Geological Survey.

The project has been assembled over a time of 10 weeks as a means of teaching the basic concepts of object-oriented programming and the java language such as
-Java Syntax
-Java data structures
-Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism
-Memory models 
-Event driven programming (response to user input)
-Basics of algorithms (sorting, searching)

It makes use of some initial skeleton code such as the parser for the RSS feed
and draws on the "UnfoldingMaps" package by Till Nagel for displaying the map objects (available at http://unfoldingmaps.org).
