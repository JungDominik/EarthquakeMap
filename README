//This is a class project as part of the UC San Diego MOOC "Object-oriented Programming in Java", offered through Coursera

//It automatically generates an interactive map of the earthquakes which happened during the past week, parsing an RSS feed by the United States Geological Survey. 
//
//It has been assembled over a time of 10 weeks. It makes use of some initial skeleton code such as the parser for the RSS feed
//and draws on the "UnfoldingMaps" package by Till Nagel for displaying the map objects (available at http://unfoldingmaps.org).
